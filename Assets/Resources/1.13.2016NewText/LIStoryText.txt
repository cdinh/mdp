ZYME: End of the digestive tract, AntiZyme!! The food is already digested, what else can you do?
ANTIZYME: You may have gotten all the nutrients, but you still need some water from what¡¯s left of the food;
ZYME: Explorer, let¡¯s absorb enough water for the body but keep some for the poop so that it¡¯s good poop!;
ZYME: <points to middle> Good poop is here on the scale where there¡¯s just the right amount of water!
<points to left side> Over here we have too much water so it¡¯s mushy, runny poop!
ANTIZYME: Well, my Bacteria Gang is going to make it watery! (AntiZyme with Bacteria Gang pop up);
ZYME: <points to right side> Over here we have too little water so it¡¯s hard poop that won¡¯t come out.
ANTIZYME: All the extra sponges/suctions that I added will squeeze out your last drop of

ZYME: Hey Explorer! It¡¯s our duty to make good poop! Ready?;
ZYME: Listen carefully! Here¡¯s our final mission:;
