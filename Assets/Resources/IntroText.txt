NARRATOR: Just an ordinary day at the Restaurant. Mr. Patron just ordered some food.
ANTIZYME: Oh-ho! What do we have here? (evil cackle)
PATRON: This looks delicious!
ANTIZYME: Heheheh! (cackles)
PATRON: (coughs) Oh my!
CHEF: Goodness me! What is wrong?
PATRON: This food... I don't know...
CHEF: I hope you aren't insulting my food?
PATRON: (cough cough)
ZYME: Hey! Down here!
CHEF: What's there? Who is that?
ZYME: Down here! My name is Zyme, and I saw what happened!
CHEF: Oh?
ZYME: The patron is sick because Antizyme hopped into his food and down his throat.
CHEF: Anti-who?
ZYME: It's ANTIZYME! He's an evil particle!
ZYME: He must have smelled the delicious food and hopped into the spoonful the Patron scooped into his mouth!
CHEF: Oh no! What can we do to stop him from making the Patron sick?
ZYME: I know what to do! I'm small enough to chase after him! I can fix this, but I need your help! Will you help me?
