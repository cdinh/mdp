The format of writing a script for the mouth game is as follows:
WAVE DELAY/WAVE TIME/FOOD SPEED/FOOD SPAWN INTERVAL

---------
Notes:

WAVE DELAY: The delay between two different waves in the same script in seconds. Higher number = longer delay

WAVE TIME: The total time that a current wave with the specified values on the line runs for in seconds.

FOOD SPEED: The speed that the food blobs in the current wave move along the ITween path in the mouth game. Higher number = faster

FOOD SPAWN INTERVAL: The interval between food blob spawns in the current wave in seconds. Higher number = longer delay.
