ZYME: Look at all this unswallowed food in the Patron's mouth! This must be Antizyme's doing! I'll bet he's been messing up the Patron's digestive tract!
ZYME: The mouth works by chewing up food into smaller pieces before it goes into the stomach.
ZYME: The tongue pushes the food back, while parts at the back of the mouth block food from going down the air passage. This makes sure that the food goes down the esophagus and into the stomach, where it belongs!
ZYME: If the parts at the back of the mouth don't do their job fast enough, then Mr. Patron's food will go into his air passage, causing him to choke.
ZYME: The mouth is designed so it's impossible to breathe and swallow at the same time.
ZYME: It looks like Antizyme has stopped the Patron from swallowing!
ZYME: I'm too small to move the food! I can try to find out how AntiZyme stopped the swallowing.
ZYME: In the meantime, I'll need your help to make sure the food goes down the esophagus correctly! Can you help the patron swallow his food?
