ZYME: Look at all this unswallowed food in the Patron's mouth! This must be Antizyme's doing! I'll bet he's been messing up the Patron's digestive tract!
ZYME: It looks like Antizyme has stopped the Patron from swallowing!
ZYME: I'm too small to move the food! I can try to find out how AntiZyme stopped the swallowing.
ZYME: In the meantime, I'll need your help to make sure the food goes down the esophagus correctly! Can you help the patron swallow his food?
