ZYME: Great work! Turns out, Antizyme tried to stop the connections between all the muscles, but they are all fixed now, thanks to you!
ZYME: Now let's jump through the stomach into the small intestine!
CHEF: Zyme! Can you hear me?
ZYME: Chef! Yes, we can hear you loud and clear!
CHEF: Have you found Antizyme yet? That Patron is getting sicker and sicker!
ZYME: We just passed the stomach and now we're in the small intestine, where the nutrients are absorbed from the digested food particles!
ZYME: Enzymes that break down the nutrients like protein and sugar are stationed here in the small intestine. As the food particles travel down the small intestine, the enzymes digest them to get the nutrients. The nutrients are then absorbed into the body.
CHEF: But wait, Zyme, where are all the enzymes?
ZYME: They're gone! I'll bet Antizyme is up to no good!
CHEF: Speaking of our favorite evil particle, I just got a postcard from Antizyme.
ANTIZYME: Myahaha! I've captured all your precious little enzyme towers so they can't go to the small intestine! The Patron will never absorb the nutrients from the food! There will be enough nutrients for all of my Bacteria Gang!
ZYME: Oh no! Antizyme has tied up all the enzymes in the Pancreas Factory! We need to help them or else the Patron won't be able to digest his food properly and he'll feel even more sick!
CHEF: Uh, if it helps, I have a few enzymes here? I'll get the Patron to eat them now!
ZYME: Great! I can see them coming now! But the enzyme towers look too big for me to carry.
ZYME: I'll go distract Antizyme. Do you think you can help lead the enzyme towers to the right spots in the small intestine?
